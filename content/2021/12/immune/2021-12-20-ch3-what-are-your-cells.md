## Notes

### Protien synthesis

- Protiens are made from chains of amino acids.
- DNA dictates: 
    - which protiens are made?
    - how are they made?
    - quantity?
    - time?
- Protiens read the information on the DNA string and produce m-RNA (messenger molecule).
- m-RNA is transported from the cell's nucleus to ribosomes.
- Ribosomes translate m-RNA into amino acids.
- These amino acids are combined in order (probably defined by DNA).

### Ant analogy and systems

- An individual ant is a simple organism. A colony of ants; is a complex system.
- They build specialized areas in the colony: brood chambers, garbage, ventilation.
- They have job distributions planned to sustain the colony.
    - Anecdote: If a group of specialized ants are killed by a foreign force, the remaining ants reorganize jobs.
    - They redistribute jobs in the same ratio.

> _Emergence_: When an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviors which emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole. [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence)
