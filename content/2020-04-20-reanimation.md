I am going through a course on [edx.org](https://courses.edx.org) named: [Fundamentals of Neuroscience, Part 1: The Electrical Properties of the Neuron](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+MCB80.1x+3T2019/course/). Binge watching lecture series are not as effective as watching movie-series. To that extent I couldn't enjoy movie series at a stretch anyway. Interest alone can only take one so far. So I decided to take a break and watch a few *treats* hidden for the later parts of the course.

I remember visiting [backyardbrains](https://backyardbrains.com/) looking for neuroscience experiments and found a bunch of tools, blogs, experiments that I wish I had found before. I see a video lecture from the same team that makes [these things](https://backyardbrains.com/products/).
