While taking a course on neuroscience, I read about how neurons communicate. This image answers one of the basic principles involved, how do neurons get charged in the first place?

So I sketched up the initial layer with the membrane (the sandwich in the middle) and distributed the ions (charged particles) on one side. Motion markers try to assist the viewer that the ions are not stationary.

Adding the location-icons is to give a perspective of distance from the viewer. "If it looks small its farther away". Even the size of ions reduces when they cross the membrane.

This image helps describe the content in [Resting Potential](./resting-potential).
