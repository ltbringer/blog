This is a series of posts related to SICP exercises, in continuation of a [previous post](https://ltbringer.github.io/blog/sicp-exercises-1-0-1-5).

The chapters that lead to the exercises are:

1. Building Abstractions with Procedures
    1. The elments of programming.
        7. Example: Square Roots by Newton's method (1 - 6 covered in previous post)
        
The chapter starts with a case for calculating square roots.

$$
\sqrt{x} = y; \text{ such that } y \geq 0 \text{ and } y^2 = x
$$

> The most common way is to use Newton’s method of successive approximations, which says that
> whenever we have a guess y for the value of the square root of a number x , we can perform a 
> simple manipulation to get a better guess (one closer to the actual square root) by 
> averaging y with x/y.

Example:


|  Guess | Quotient            | Average                        |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
|      1 | (2/1) = 2           | ((2 + 1) / 2) = 1.5            |
|    1.5 | (2/1.5) = 1.3333    | ((1.33 + 1.5)/2) = 1.41        |
|  1.416 | (2/1.4167) = 1.4118 | ((1.4167 + 1.4118)/2) = 1.4142 |
| 1.4142 | ...                 | ...                            |

Using the above, we get to the following strategy:

```scheme
;; Missing procedures will be created later.
(define (sqrt-iter guess x) 
  (if (good-enough? guess x) 
    guess 
    (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```


Now we need another procedure to improve our guess:

```scheme
;; Reference to the example table.
(define (average-of-two x y) 
  (/ (+ x y) 2))
  
(define (improve guess x) 
  (average-of-two guess (/ guess x)))
```

The `good-enough?` procedure is a measure of how close the guess is to the square of original number. We can express this as:

```scheme
;; precision is a metric of closeness required for the guess 
;; to be the square root of x.
(define (good-enough? guess x) 
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) <precision>))

(define (square x) 
  (* x x))
```

Finally we can have:

```scheme
;; A default guess of 1.0 is chosen.
(define (sqrt x) 
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
```

There is some emphasis on being able to express the above without the need of loops, compared to other standard languages.

**Exercise 1.6:** Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to be provided as a special form. “Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?” she asks. Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of if:

```scheme
;; Implementing `if` to work using `cond`
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
  (else else-clause)))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

```scheme
;; Some tests
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
;;-> 5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
;; -> 0
```

Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:

```scheme
;; The final implementation of sqrt-iter
;; assuming other procedures are same as above.
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
    guess
    (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

*Answer:* `new-if` is a _procedure_ and `if` is a _special form_. That means, the `sqrt-iter` would be evaluated differently.

```scheme
;; Expanded form 
(new-if 
  (good-enough? guess x) 
    guess 
    (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x))
```
We have a problem here, `if` behaves lazily, so it will first evaluate the *predicate* `(good-enough? guess x)` first and the evaluation of *consequent* or *alternative* will be deferred until then.

Instead of that, we have `new-if` which is a procedure and not a **special-form** causing all the arguments to be evaluated after the operator. This would cause the `(sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)` to be evaluated irrespective of the output of `(good-enough)` as per the _applicative order_ of procedures, leading to a non-terminating condition.

`if` follows _normal order_ of evaluation and hence, the arguments will be evaluated depending after, and, on the output of the _predicate_. The stopping condition being _predicate_ returning `true`.
