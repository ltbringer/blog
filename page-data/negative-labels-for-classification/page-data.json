As feature engineers, we try to reduce a sentence into its bare minimum form. Pulling out signal from the noise. A lack of a rigorous approach makes it hard to justify which reductions are appropriate, also, are these reductions appropriate for the set of all sentences? even if these sentences strictly belong to the business requirement? Are business requirements as strict as they should be to answer these questions?</p>\n<p>Maybe, noise is not meant to be stripped off even if it represents a minority.
