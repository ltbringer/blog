Here we have a certain <em>dir path</em> which gets majority of the commits. I want to get logs between period A (this is when a new repository was born to handle everything but have a lighter code base) to period B (say, today's date). I have a certain <code class=\"language-text\">dir</code> that I can ignore as it doesn't align with the objectives of the new repository.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">git log</code> accepts a <code class=\"language-text\">pathspec</code> form to exclude directories. Which means you can do:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> log -p repo_dir <span class=\"token string\">':!repo_dir/path/to/exclude_dir'</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>At this point I could also see the features I have added. I wanted to skip those too. Turns out there is a neat argument for that too.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> log -p --author<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token string\">'^((?!authorname).*)$'</span> repo_dir <span class=\"token string\">':!repo_dir/path/to/exclude_dir'</span></code></pre></div>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"Recently I was working on a project where I had to port features from a growing but to-be-marked legacy system.
